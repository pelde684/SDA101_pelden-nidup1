## Challanges faced:
1. Centering Content and Layout

Challenge: Difficulty in centering the main container and aligning the navigation bar horizontally.

Solution: Used CSS margin: auto for the container and Flexbox (display: flex; justify-content: center;) for the navigation links.

Solution: Applied CSS pseudo-classes (:hover) to change link colors and background on hover, making navigation interactive
