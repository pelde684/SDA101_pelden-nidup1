# What skills have you applied
Semantic HTML – Used <form>, <fieldset>, <legend>, <label>, <input>, <select>, and <textarea> to structure the form logically and accessibly.

HTML5 Form Validation – Applied attributes like required, pattern, min, max, and type to validate inputs such as student ID, phone number, and room number.

CSS Styling – Created a clean, modern design with consistent styling for inputs, labels, and buttons.

Responsive Design – Used relative units (em, rem, %, vh, vw) and media queries to make the form usable on different screen sizes.

Focus States & UX Enhancements – Styled input focus states and placeholders for better user experience.

UI Design Principles – Organized the form with clear sections, spacing, and visual hierarchy to guide the user.

Problem-Solving – Addressed challenges like layout alignment, input validation, and accessibility.

Interactivity – Made the submit button visually prominent to encourage form submission.

## Challanges faced and how have you overcome it
I have face certain challenges while inputting validation like:
Challenge: Ensuring that all form fields accept only valid input, e.g., student ID must be exactly 8 digits, full name only letters and spaces, phone number 8 digits.

Solution: Used HTML5 attributes like pattern, required, min, max, and type to enforce proper input validation.
